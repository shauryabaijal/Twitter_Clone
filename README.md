# twitter-clone


## Description

A full-stack Twitter clone app built using Node.js, Express.js, React.js, and MongoDB.

### Background

The project was originally created a few years ago and as I have learned a lot since then I recently decided to update it and create the base for developing new features.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a running MongoDB instance.

### Installing

Install server dependencies

```bash
$ cd server
$ npm install
```

Install client dependencies

```bash
$ cd client
$ npm install
```

### Start the server and client

```bash
$ npm start
```


If everything was successful, you should see the messages being displayed in the terminal, telling that the server has successfully connected to a MongoDB and runs on a given port.

Now, the app should be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running the tests

### Server

To test API routes

```bash
# run all tests
$ npm test

# or

# run all tests in watch mode
$ npm run test:watch
```
